>> TFT_Conway

Test your TFT display with this interesting evolving pattern! 

_Note: I implemented this version of Conway's Game to have zoom levels! I set default zoom to 3, meaning each cell will be 3x3 pixels. If you have a large display and only a stm32 to power it, you will be happy to have the option of scaling the simulation!!_

This is a [platform.io](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide) project, which simplifies tooling for different devices and displays, just like ArduinoIDE.

Configure the drivers/dependencies you need in the <mark>platformio.ini</mark> file and then just flash the program to your device!
